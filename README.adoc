**The definitive Prolog static site generator.**

== Overview

prodigy-ssg is a logic-based static site generator written in Prolog.
Site structure and content relationships are expressed as logical facts
and rules, allowing for powerful querying and validation.

== Language Enforcement

[IMPORTANT]
====
This SSG **MUST** be written in Prolog. No exceptions.

Forbidden languages for SSG logic:

* Python
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* Datalog (use full Prolog)
* Any language other than Prolog

The **ONLY** non-Prolog code allowed is the ReScript MCP adapter in `adapters/`.
====

== Features

* Declarative site definitions using facts
* Automatic backtracking for template resolution
* Built-in constraint solving for complex layouts
* Pattern matching for content routing
* Query interface for site metadata

== Requirements

* SWI-Prolog 8.0+
